road, hitching a ride with some earnest young Canadians who are planning
 a hike through some of the last unspoiled wilderness in North America 
in the dense forests of Maine. They part ways after sharing a hot meal, 
and Reacher checks out a quiet town surrounded by countryside serene 
enough to cool even his raging wanderlust. But not for long. First the 
trail is suddenly and inexplicably closed. Then the military police show
 up in force. Maybe it's a drill. Or maybe it's troubleâ€”the kind of 
trouble that always finds Reacher, no matter how far he travels off the 
beaten path.&lt;/span&gt;</dc:description></dp:metadata><dp:privateData xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><totalPageCount xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/digitaleditions">35</totalPageCount></dp:privateData><dp:tags xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><dp:tag>private:ub5</dp:tag></dp:tags></contentRecord>
