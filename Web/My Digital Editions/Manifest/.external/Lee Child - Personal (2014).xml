shot at the president of France in the City of Light. The bullet was 
American. The distance between the gunman and the target was 
exceptional. How many snipers can shoot from three-quarters of a mile 
with total confidence? Very few, but John Kott—an American marksman gone
 bad—is one of them. And after fifteen years in prison, he’s out, 
unaccounted for, and likely drawing a bead on a G8 summit packed with 
enough world leaders to tempt any assassin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anyone can stop 
Kott, it’s the man who beat him before: Reacher. And though he’d rather 
work alone, Reacher is teamed with Casey Nice, a rookie analyst who 
keeps her cool with Zoloft. But they’re facing a rough road, full of 
ruthless mobsters, Serbian thugs, close calls, double-crosses—and no 
backup if they’re caught. All the while Reacher can’t stop thinking 
about the woman he once failed to save. But he won’t let that that 
happen again. Not this time. Not Nice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</dc:description></dp:metadata><dp:privateData xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><totalPageCount xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/digitaleditions">327</totalPageCount></dp:privateData><dp:tags xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><dp:tag>private:ub5</dp:tag></dp:tags></contentRecord>
