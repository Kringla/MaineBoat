dentist is met in his office parking lot by three men and ordered into 
the trunk of his Lexus. On a downtown sidewalk, Jack Reacher and an 
unknown woman are abducted in broad daylight by two men - practiced and 
confident - who stop them at gunpoint and hustle them into the same 
sedan. Then Reacher and the woman are switched into a second vehicle and
 hauled away, leaving the dentist bound and gagged inside his car with 
the woman's abandoned possessions, two gallons of gasoline. . . and a 
burning match. The FBI is desperate to rescue the woman, a Special Agent
 from the Chicago office, because the FBI always - always - takes care 
of its own, and because this woman is not just another agent. Reacher 
and the woman join forces, against seemingly hopeless odds, to outwit 
their captors and escape. But the FBI thinks Jack is one of the 
kidnappers - and when they close in, the Bureau snipers will be shooting
 to kill.&lt;/span&gt;</dc:description></dp:metadata><dp:privateData xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><totalPageCount xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/digitaleditions">382</totalPageCount></dp:privateData><dp:tags xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><dp:tag>private:ub5</dp:tag></dp:tags></contentRecord>
