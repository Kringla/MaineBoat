is still in the army. In the morning they give him a medal, and in the 
afternoon they send him back to school. That night he’s off the grid. 
Out of sight, out of mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two other men are in the classroom—an 
FBI agent and a CIA analyst. Each is a first-rate operator, each is 
fresh off a big win, and each is wondering what the hell they are doing 
there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then they find out: A Jihadist sleeper cell in Hamburg, 
Germany, has received an unexpected visitor—a Saudi courier, seeking 
safe haven while waiting to rendezvous with persons unknown. A CIA 
asset, undercover inside the cell, has overheard the courier whisper a 
chilling message: “The American wants a hundred million dollars.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For
 what? And who from? Reacher and his two new friends are told to find 
the American. Reacher recruits the best soldier he has ever worked with:
 Sergeant Frances Neagley. Their mission heats up in more ways than one,
 while always keeping their eyes on the prize: If they don’t get their 
man, the world will suffer an epic act of terrorism.&lt;/span&gt;</dc:description></dp:metadata><dp:privateData xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><totalPageCount xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/digitaleditions">306</totalPageCount></dp:privateData><dp:tags xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><dp:tag>private:ub5</dp:tag></dp:tags></contentRecord>
