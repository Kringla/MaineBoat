 That’s all Reacher wants to know. But no one will tell him. It’s a tiny
 place hidden in a thousand square miles of wheat fields, with a 
railroad stop, and sullen and watchful people, and a worried woman named
 Michelle Chang, who mistakes him for someone else: her missing partner 
in a private investigation she thinks must have started small and then 
turned lethal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Reacher has no particular place to go, and all 
the time in the world to get there, and there’s something about Chang . .
 . so he teams up with her and starts to ask around. He thinks: How bad 
can this thing be? But before long he’s plunged into a desperate race 
through LA, Chicago, Phoenix, and San Francisco, and through the hidden 
parts of the internet, up against thugs and assassins every step of the 
way—right back to where he started, in Mother’s Rest, where he must 
confront the worst nightmare he could imagine.&lt;/span&gt;</dc:description></dp:metadata><dp:privateData xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><totalPageCount xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/digitaleditions">343</totalPageCount></dp:privateData><dp:tags xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><dp:tag>private:ub5</dp:tag></dp:tags></contentRecord>
