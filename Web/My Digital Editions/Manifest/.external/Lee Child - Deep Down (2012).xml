Intelligence to Washington, D.C., Reacher is sent undercover. The 
assignment that awaits him: The army is meeting with its Capitol Hill 
paymasters for classified talks on a new, state-of-the-art sniper rifle 
for U.S. forces. But vital details about the weapon are leaking—straight
 from the Capitol and probably into the hands of unidentified foreign 
arms dealers. The prospect of any and every terrorist, mercenary, or 
dictator’s militia getting their hands on the latest superior firepower 
is unthinkable. That’s where Reacher comes in. His task: infiltrate the 
top-secret proceedings and smoke out the mole. His target: a quartet of 
high-powered Army political liaison officers—all of them fast-track 
women on their way to the top.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to his bosses, it’s a 
zero-danger mission. No need to draw a gun . . . just chat over drinks. 
But Reacher knows that things are rarely what they seem. And he’s 
learned the hard way never to underestimate an opponent. Or four. 
Lessons that will come in handy when he starts digging for the truth—and
 gets his hands a lot dirtier than he expected.&lt;/span&gt;</dc:description></dp:metadata><dp:privateData xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><totalPageCount xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/digitaleditions">48</totalPageCount></dp:privateData><dp:tags xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><dp:tag>private:ub5</dp:tag></dp:tags></contentRecord>
