California, James Penney is laid off from the plant after seventeen 
loyal years of service. With the threat of the bank repossessing his

 'Guy Walks Into a Bar', old habits die hard for Jack Reacher. He is 
always on the look-out for trouble. When he stops at a bar in lower 
Manhattan for a late night beer and some music, his eyes are drawn to a 
rich young Russian girl and her bodyguard. Is she in danger? Who are 
those two suspicious-looking guys sitting at separate tables, watching 
her?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</dc:description></dp:metadata><dp:privateData xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><totalPageCount xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/digitaleditions">35</totalPageCount></dp:privateData><dp:tags xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><dp:tag>private:ub5</dp:tag></dp:tags></contentRecord>
