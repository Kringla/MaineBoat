major oil producers with global reach. While cruising in the Indian Ocean, 
Hazel's private yacht is hijacked by African pirates. Hazel is not on board at 
the time, but her nineteen year old daughter, Cayla, is kidnapped and held to 
ransom. The pirates demand a crippling twenty billion dollar ransom for her 
release. Complicated political and diplomatic considerations render the 
civilized major powers incapable of intervening. When Hazel is given evidence of 
the horrific torture which Cayla is being subjected to, she calls on Hector 
Cross to help her rescue her daughter. Hector is the owner and operator of Cross 
Bow Security, the company which is contracted to Bannock Oil to provide all 
their security. He is a formidable fighting man. Between them Hazel and Hector 
are determined to take the law into their own hands.&lt;/div&gt;</dc:description></dp:metadata><dp:privateData xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><totalPageCount xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/digitaleditions">312</totalPageCount></dp:privateData><dp:tags xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><dp:tag>private:ub3</dp:tag></dp:tags></contentRecord>
