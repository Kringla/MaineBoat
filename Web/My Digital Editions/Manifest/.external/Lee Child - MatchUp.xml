&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for *FACEOFF&lt;/strong&gt;*   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So good it demands a sequel.” (Publishers Weekly)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A thriller reader’s ultimate fantasy. How cool would it be if a pair of celebrated crime fiction protagonists, the creations of different authors, teamed up together on a case, in a story jointly penned by the two writers? Even if it was just 1 pair, it would be pretty darn cool, but 11 pairs? Way cool. . . . Great fun for thriller fans.” (Booklist)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A marvelous anthology. This innovative concept entertains as each author works in concert with another to deliver a story worth every word on the page." (RT Book Reviews, 4.5 Star Review)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Familiarity with the authors and their creations is a huge plus in reading this collection, but not knowing a particular character or writer should not be a deterrent. . . . Some great collaborations and stories.” (The Associated Press)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An impressive accomplishment that celebrates the genre in both style &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; substance. Enthusiasts will dig it for what it is—an abundance of chills and thrills delivered by an inspired lineup of literary heavyweights—while casual readers just might be tempted to pick it up for the sheer novelty of it all. Regardless of motivation, they will find themselves turning pages late into the night. This just may be the optimal summer read.” (Hartford Books Examiner)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A box of chocolates. You can start at one corner and methodically gorge yourself, or study the chart and pick out the caramels. With an anthology, you can start at page 1 and read through, or peruse the table of contents for favorite writers. If the anthology is good enough, it won't matter. And &lt;em&gt;FaceOff &lt;/em&gt;is. In fact, it is brilliant. . . . The teaming up is what makes this anthology so special. It's a fair bet that fans will first turn to their favorite authors, but after devouring those stories, try the others. It is like a wonderful box of chocolates without the guilt.” (The Newark Star Ledger)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;FaceOff&lt;/em&gt; is like a literary &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt;.” (The Chicago Tribune)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pow! That’s the sound of thriller fans’ heads exploding when they hear the bold premise of this anthology. . . . This collection is 11 fever dreams come true.” (Reader’s Digest)  &lt;/p&gt;
