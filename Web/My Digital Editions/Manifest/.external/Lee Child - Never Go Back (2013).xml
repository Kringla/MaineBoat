interrupted journey all the way from the snows of South Dakota, Jack 
Reacher has finally made it to Virginia. His destination: a sturdy stone
 building a short bus ride from Washington D.C., the headquarters of his
 old unit, the 110th MP. It was the closest thing to a home he ever had.&lt;p&gt;Why?
 He wants to meet the new commanding officer, Major Susan Turner. He 
liked her voice on the phone. But the officer sitting behind Reacher’s 
old desk isn't a woman. Why is Susan Turner not there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What 
Reacher doesn’t expect is what comes next. He himself is in big trouble,
 accused of a sixteen-year-old homicide. And he certainly doesn't expect
 to hear these words: ‘You’re back in the army, Major. And your ass is 
mine.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</dc:description></dp:metadata><dp:privateData xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><totalPageCount xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/digitaleditions">401</totalPageCount></dp:privateData><dp:tags xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><dp:tag>private:ub5</dp:tag></dp:tags></contentRecord>
