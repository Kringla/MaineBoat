hoping to make Chicago by morning. One man driving, eyes on the road. 
Another man next to him, telling stories that don’t add up. A woman in 
the back, silent and worried. And next to her, a huge man with a broken 
nose, hitching a ride east to Virginia.&lt;p&gt; An hour behind them, a man 
lies stabbed to death in an old pumping station. He was seen going in 
with two others, but he never came out. He has been executed, the knife 
work professional, the killers vanished. Within minutes, the police are 
notified. Within hours, the FBI descends, laying claim to the victim 
without ever saying who he was or why he was there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Reacher 
wanted was a ride to Virginia. All he did was stick out his thumb. But 
he soon discovers he has hitched more than a ride. He has tied himself 
to a massive conspiracy that makes him a threat—to both sides at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</dc:description></dp:metadata><dp:privateData xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><totalPageCount xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/digitaleditions">410</totalPageCount></dp:privateData><dp:tags xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><dp:tag>private:ub5</dp:tag></dp:tags></contentRecord>
